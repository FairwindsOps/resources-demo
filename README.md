# Resource Requests/Limits Demo

## Introduction

Setting resource requests and limits properly is the very first step towards building a stable and efficient Kubernetes cluster. Setting them incorrectly can lead to very interesting and unstable situations. The goal of these demos is to show different situations that can be cause by incorrect settings.


## Demo 1 - no requests or limits

## Demo 2 - cpu limits too low - cpu throttling

## Demo 3 - memory limits too low - OOM Kill

## Demo 4 - requests with no limits

## Demo 5 - requests and limits are far apart
